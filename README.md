yakui-miniquad
-----------------------
[![CI](https://github.com/profan/yakui-miniquad/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/profan/yakui-miniquad/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

This is a simple library integrating yakui with miniquad, allowing you to use yakui with your miniquad projects easily.

Feel free to use this as you wish, I will maintain a simple feature matrix here with what version of this crate corresponds to which version of miniquad and yakui, so you can pick the one you should be using.

One version which is always on the latest stable miniquad and yakui crate will be maintained, along with one version in another branch which can be used for those who are on older miniquad versions for some reason (such as myself, though this may change).

I'm happy to accept contributions in the form of fixes or improvements, just be nice :)

# Version
This version is for macroquad 0.3.x and yakui 0.2.0.

# Example
See [the example](examples/hello-world/main.rs), you can also `cargo run --example hello-world` to test the example.
